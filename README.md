# melpa2nix
Automatically generate Nix expressions for Emacs packages

This project is essentially defunct because I have decided to take a different approach that leans more heavily on the `package-build.el` infrastructure. You can see my progress in my fork of [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/ttuegel/nixpkgs/blob/emacs-packages/pkgs/build-support/emacs/melpa2nix.el).

  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2018-06-08 Fri 09:56]

* TODO Get package descriptions
* DONE Get package licenses

All Emacs packages must be licensed GPL-3.

* TODO Keep a bidirectional map of names

A bidirectional map of names is useful to get Emacs names after parsing the package index from Nix. Keeping the map in the Nixpkgs tree makes it configurable.

* TODO Define exceptions ad hoc

* TODO Switch to async-pool

melpa2nix spawns thousands of threads when it starts, using a semaphore to allow a select few to run at a time. Instead, use async-pool to establish a TaskGroup allowing only the selected number of threads to spawn at a time.

* TODO Switch to hpack

The .cabal file is a mess of duplicated information. Switch to hpack for a clean package definition.

* TODO Generate commit message and changelog
